🛒 Front-End eCommerce Web Page
This is a basic front-end eCommerce web page that I created during my first year of BCA when I was just starting to learn web development. It was one of my first projects where I experimented with HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript to build a simple online store layout.

🔰 Purpose
The main goal of this project was to:

Practice building structured web pages using HTML

Style elements using CSS to create a clean layout

Understand how to create a responsive product grid

Try basic interactivity with JavaScript

🧩 Features
A homepage with a product listing layout

Basic navigation bar

Product cards with images, names, prices, and buttons

Static content only (no backend or dynamic data)

Designed to look like a simple shopping site

🛠️ Tech Stack
HTML5

CSS3

JavaScript (basic, for minor interactivity)

📌 Note
This project is a beginner-level static website. There is no backend, payment gateway, or cart functionality. It was made purely for learning purposes and to build confidence with front-end skills.
